# How to use GitHub with RStudio

Though it may seem like a headache at first, incorporating GitHub into your workflow has lots of benefits. This is not only the case for collaborating with others on research, but also for solo projects. 

To learn more about *why* GitHub, here's an excellent introduction:

  - Bryan, Jennifer. 2017. "Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?" [link](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/)
  
I use GitHub for almost all of my projects. Doing this requires using both RStudio and Git. The latest versions of each can be found at:

  - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
  - [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
  

# Exercise for Math Camp 2021 Students at UIUC

The best way to learn version control is to use it. To that end, graduate students attending math camp should -> copy the link to this repository -> open a new project in RStudio -> select version control -> select Git -> save the new project.

After you've done this, create a new .Rmd file that has your name as the document name (e.g., milesWilliams.Rmd). Save this file to the "01_student_uploads" folder in the repository. In this file, include your name and your favorite dessert.

After you've knitted the file to a .pdf, *you'll make your first commit!* To do this, click the "Git" tab in RStudio -> select "Commit" -> check all of the new files produced in your session -> make a "Commit" message -> select "Commit" -> then select *pull* -> then select *push*.

That's it!
